# React Project: Social Network for Pets
In this project, we’ll build a simple social network for pets.  

You’ll be able to view a pet’s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles.

There will also be a profile directory where you can see all of the profiles.

We’ve already set up three profiles for you: one for a cat, one for a dog, and one for a Komodo dragon.

### Available Scripts
Run `npm install` inside the project's root directory (make sure you have Node installed on your computer)

Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Open [https://petsocialnetwork-qnn.surge.sh/](https://petsocialnetwork-qnn.surge.sh/) to view it in deployed version.
