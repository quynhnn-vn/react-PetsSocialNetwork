## React Project: Social Network for Pets
In this project, we’ll build a simple social network for pets.  
You’ll be able to view a pet’s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles.  
There will also be a profile directory where you can see all of the profiles.
We’ve already set up three profiles for you: one for a cat, one for a dog, and one for a Komodo dragon.

Open [https://petsocialnetwork-qnn.surge.sh/](https://petsocialnetwork-qnn.surge.sh/) to view it in deployed version.
